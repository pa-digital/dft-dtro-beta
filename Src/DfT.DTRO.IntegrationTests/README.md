To execute the integration tests against localhost, run one of the following commands:

```
# From Src/DfT.DTRO.IntegrationTests:
dotnet test

# From the project root:
./run_integration_tests.sh
./run_integration_tests.sh local
```

You can view the test results at Src/DfT.DTRO.IntegrationTests/TestResults/test-results.trx (in Visual Studio only).
